# Chain Reaction Data Journalism Project :bicycle: :chart_with_upwards_trend: :newspaper:

Hello there! :wave:

Welcome to my data journalism project, as part of the Diploma in Applied AI & Analytics. I've been working with data from Chain Reaction (CR), an international bicycle and accessories manufacturer, using Tableau to create interactive dashboards and data stories. :bar_chart: :bike: :earth_americas:

## Project Overview :page_with_curl:

This project focuses on the analysis of various aspects of Chain Reaction's sales performance. These include:

Sales Analysis by Channel (Customer & Reseller) :busts_in_silhouette: :money_with_wings:
Sales Analysis by Product :bike: :shirt: :gloves: :gear:
Sales Analysis by Region :world_map: :round_pushpin:
Overall Sales Performance :chart_with_upwards_trend: :dollar:
We also dive deep into the data to find other factors that have contributed to the sales performance. The aim is to provide valid recommendations to Chain Reaction to improve their future sales. :rocket:
